## abcMIDI package

abcMIDI is a package of programs written in C for handling abc music notation files. The software was created by James Allwright in the early 1990 and presently maintained by Seymour Shlien. It initially included the following programs:

1. abc2midi for converting an abc file to a midi file,
2. abc2abc for transposing abc notation to another key signature,
3. midi2abc for creating an abc file from a midi file,
4. yaps for producing producing a PostScript file displaying the music notation and,
5. mftext for creating a text representation of a midi file.

Seymour added two more programs:

1. abcmatch for finding common elements in a collection of abc tunes and,
2. midicopy for copying parts of a midi file to a new midi file.

The latest version of the abcMIDI package can be found on https://sourceforge.net/projects/abc/ or https://ifdo.ca/~seymour/runabc/top.html
